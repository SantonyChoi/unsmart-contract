# unsmart-contract

Recently, scalability of blockchain has become a hot potato. Ethereum, one of the most popular smart contract platform, is suffering for several issues such as high transaction fee and traffic on the network.

One solution suggested is "side chain". Users only record their sign in and out on a main chain and all the other actual transactions are recorded in the side chain. Main chain can reduce the load and users can get almost same level of reliability. Isn't it great?

Although it looks simple, it's not. So, I'd like to suggest more simple solution as a temporary expedient. It's name is "Unsmart contract".
